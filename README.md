### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:wrench: - I'm Hugo, an **engineering student at [Telecom Sudparis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu), in game dev specialisation**. There I get to learn about many aspects of telecommunications along with programming languages such as Bash, Java, C#, PHP and so on. But truth be told, I am here to learn about video game making. 

---
#### What I do

:alarm_clock: - I absolutely love taking part in **Game Jams**. The objective is to form a team and develop a video game from scratch in 48 hours. Have a look at the games I took part in the making:
- [Sort'it 'till you make it](https://skizaat.itch.io/sortit-till-you-make-it) | Unijam 2021 | **Lead developer**
- [Geckolot](https://mathieu-coutant.itch.io/geckolot) | Global Game Jam 2022 | **Lead graphic designer & developer**
- [Neon Dice](https://flegmatik-surf.itch.io/neon-dice) | GTMK Game Jam 2022 | **Lead graphic designer**
- [Steppe by Steppe](https://akasuna.itch.io/steppe-by-step) | Archeological Game Jam - Etiolles 2022 | **Developer**

:pencil2: - I also do **Pixel Art** when I have time. I've been part of a lot of awesome video game projects lately, be it as a graphic designer or developper. Come have a look, I post most of my drawings [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/K0huro/posts/).. I'm using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) which is a fantastic tool for Pixel Art.

# **My professionnal experience**

<br/>

The team working on [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) has been so kind as to welcome me **twice** for an internship during the Summers of 2021 and 2022. **Mockoon** is an open sourced dev tool that helps you design and mock APIs in seconds. There, I got to work on the project and add my little contribution to the application while getting a hang of Javascript, Typescript, Angular, NodeJS and so on.

### **Dungeon Speaker, an academic dev project**

<br/>

**Dungeon Speaker** is a *text-based* dungeon crawler inspired from [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/). We worked on it as a team of four junior students at Telecom Sudparis for our **oriented object programming** class. Sadly, being our first game, the build was somewhat messy and is not playable anymore. 

<br/>

### **Sort'it 'till you make it, our 2021 Unijam project**

<br/>

<img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTI3NjU4Ny83NDM4NjQyLmpwZw==/original/qgxAdK.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">

Sort'it 'till you make it was the game made during my first Game Jam, the 2021 **Unijam**. The aim is to sort trash properly while putting aside some items to sell them of the black market for extra cash. Still, you must not get caught by your boss while stealing trash.   

While the scope was very optimistic, we still managed to produce a playable game. It lacks polish but taught us to define a clear and concise scope when starting a Jam.

Play the game on [Itchi.io](https://skizaat.itch.io/sortit-till-you-make-it).

### **Geckolot, our 2022 Global Game Jam project**

<br/>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41008899/153009120-aeb54a6e-a5ba-48bc-9e63-17574a7d7fa1.png" width="50%" height="50%">

Geckolot is a two-player plateformer inspired by the theme **Duality** for the 2022 Global Game Jam. You can either control an extroverted axolotl with attraction powers or an introverted gecko that tends to push others away. 

Play the game on [Itchi.io](https://mathieu-coutant.itch.io/geckolot) or check out our project in more details [here](https://github.com/Hugo-Carbiener/Geckolot)!

(No but really... go check it out... it's really cool! :eyes:)

### **Neon Dice, our 2022 GMTK Game Jam project**

<br/>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41008899/188655584-762db231-84c5-4257-bd18-8f34a10e9bef.gif" width="50%" height="50%">

Neon Dice is a two player **hack n' slash** inspired by the theme **Roll of the Dice** for the 2022 GMTK Game Jam. Each player controls one of the two dices. Each face of your dice corresponds to a particular weapon with a fixed amount of ammunition. If you run out of ammo, you will have to regroup with your teammate so they can roll you. But beware, if you get rolled, your weapon will most likely change as well, so be prepared!   

Despite a few issues during the developpement, the game turned out accordingly to our expectations and I am particularly proud of the art and of the workflow I managed to achieve. 

Play the game on [Itchi.io](https://flegmatik-surf.itch.io/neon-dice).

### **Adventures under the sea, a school project in C++**

<br/>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41008899/188661302-7964cf80-6fd9-4c19-91b1-cd6c5ce0ec22.png" width="50%" height="50%">

Adventures under the sea was a **school project** made to learn the basics of c++. This project was a co-realised with [Henri Nomico](https://github.com/BiscuitPrime). This game is heavily inspired by [Into the Breach](https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/) and uses librairies such as SFML and ImGUI. All the sprites are handmade. 

I am particularily proud to have managed to implement a system to display isometric tilemaps quickly and easily.
Check out the game [here](https://github.com/BiscuitPrime/Adventures-Under-The-Sea).

### **Steppe by step, our Archeologic Game Jam project**

<br/>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41008899/194828151-81457301-b07a-49a2-ae49-9b22ab2412d9.png" width="50%" height="50%">

Steppe by step is a single player game where you control a tribe of hunter gatherers through the prehistorical steppe in search of traces that could lead you towards the herd of reindeer roaming this place. This game was made during the Archeological Game Jam that took place in the C19 incubator in Evry, France in partnership with the excavation site of Etiolles, France. 

I took part in this Jam as **developer** this time. As expected, the weekend was not exactly smooth sailing and we encoutered many hurdles from trying to work with [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) to using data issued by the archeologists to add realistic details.

During the Game Jam, I got to meet and befriend two amazing sound designers and an archeologist. This was a truly rich human experience! 

Play the game on [Itch.io](https://akasuna.itch.io/steppe-by-step)!
