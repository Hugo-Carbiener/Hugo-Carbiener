### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:wrench: - I'm Hugo, an **engineering student at [Telecom Sudparis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu)**. There I get to learn about many aspects of telecommunications along with programming languages such as Bash, Java, C#, PHP and so on. But truth be told, I am here to learn about video game making.

#### What I do

:video_game: - Gaming my way through the pandemic, [check it out](https://ggapp.io/Kohuro/collection)!

:pencil2: - I also do **Pixel Art** when I have time. I've been part of a lot of awesome video game projects lately, be it as a graphic designer or developper. Come have a look, I post most of my drawings [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/K0huro/posts/).. I'm using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) which is a fantastic tool for Pixel Art.

:alarm_clock: - In the last few months, I took part in my first **Game Jams**. The objective is to form a team and develop a video game from scratch in 48 hours. Have a look at the games I took part in the making:
- [Sort'it 'till you make it](https://skizaat.itch.io/sortit-till-you-make-it) | Unijam 2021 | **Lead developper**
- [Geckolot](https://mathieu-coutant.itch.io/geckolot) | Global Game Jam 2022 | **Lead graphic designer & Developper**

### **Geckolot, our 2022 Global Game Jam project**

![Coveritch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41008899/153009120-aeb54a6e-a5ba-48bc-9e63-17574a7d7fa1.png)
Geckolot is a two-player plateformer inspired by the theme **Duality** for the 2022 Global Game Jam. You can either control an extroverted axolotl with attraction powers or an introverted gecko that tends to push others away. 

Play the game on [Itchi.io](https://mathieu-coutant.itch.io/geckolot) or check out our project in more details [here](https://github.com/Hugo-Carbiener/Geckolot)!
